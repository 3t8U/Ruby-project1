#### _This is an application that determines if two words are an anagram_

#### By _**Nate Powers**_

## Description

_This application allows the user to input two words and discover if they are an anagram or not_

_https://github.com/3t8U/Ruby-project1_

##Specs

* _The application takes two words, makes them lowercase and eliminates all whitespace_

* _The application checks to see if the words contains any special characters_

* _The application analyzes the words to determine if they are the same length_

* _The application checks to see if the words contain vowels and that they, are in fact words_

* _If the words are the same length  and are actual words then, the words are checked to see if they are anagrams by containing the same letters_

* _If the words are not anagrams, they are checked to see if they are anti grams_

* _The application checks multiple words against the same criteria_



## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Install GEMs and enter two words or sentences_


## Known Bugs

_No known bugs_

## Support and contact details

_Any questions, comments or contributions please contact Nate Powers (Russellsproutz@Gmail.com)_

## Technologies Used
